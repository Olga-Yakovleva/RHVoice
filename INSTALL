To compile the package type 'scons'. Then type 'scons install'. If you
want to change the installation prefix, then the first command should
be 'scons prefix=<path>'. Type 'scons -h' for help.

                              How to use
Run 'RHVoice --help' to see the supported command line options.
If you want to configure Voiceman tu use RHVoice for Russian output,
you should add a new output section in voiceman.conf. Here's an
example:

[output]
name = RHVoice
type = command
lang = rus
synth command = "RHVoice -r %r -p %p -v %v -W Elena"
alsa player command = "play -"
pitch num digits after dot = 2
pitch min = 0
pitch aver = 50
pitch max = 100
rate num digits after dot = 2
rate min = 0
rate aver = 50
rate max = 100
volume num digits after dot = 2
volume min = 0
volume aver = 50
volume max = 100
