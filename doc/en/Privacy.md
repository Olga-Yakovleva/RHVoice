# Privacy Policy

The following information applies to RHVoice, a speech synthesizer developed by Olga Yakovleva. It's source code is published at <https://github.com/RHVoice/RHVoice>.

RHVoice may use third-party services who collect personal information. This document will list such services and explain when they are used. If you use the corresponding functionality of RHVoice, you agree to the terms and conditions stated in the privacy policies of those services.

RHVoice itself collects no personal information.

After RHVoice converts a piece of text into speech, it forgets about this text: no part of the text or the generated speech is kept by RHVoice.

Speech synthesis is performed locally, on the user's device, without transferring any part of the text or the generated speech to a remote server.

The RHVoice app for Android uses [Bintray](https://bintray.com), a third-party hosting service, to host its language and voice data files. When you choose to install a voice and RHVoice downloads the necessary files from Bintray, Bintray may collect your metadata, such as your IP address. Please see the Bintray's [Privacy Policy](https://bintray.com/docs/privacy_policy.html) for more details.
